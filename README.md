Our closed loop controller and step response test system is used to determine the best operating point of the system, which is the motor with flywheel. We found that KP of 0.5 gave the best performance because the system reached steady at the fastest rate. KP of 5 made the system overshoot and had some oscillation before coming to rest. KP of 0.08 made the system behave like an overdamped system.
